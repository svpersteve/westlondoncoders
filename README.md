### About West London Coders

We're an engaging, inclusive and collaborative meetup for new and experienced
developers to learn, discuss and practice code.

Most of our members are interested in Python, iOS, Ruby, JavaScript and Front
End web development.

We split into rooms based on our language interests and:

* Build technical projects in groups or individually

* Pair up on code challenges

* Network with other developers

* Learn about people's career experiences in software engineering We are beginner friendly and you don't need to know anything about programming to join us.

### Contributing

Ensure your machine is setup to run Ruby on Rails

Clone the repo to download it to your machine

Run `bundle install` to install dependecies

Run `bundle exec rails db:migrate` to setup and migrate the database

Run `spring rspec` to run all the tests

Run `rubocop` to run the linter to check you haven't broken any 'best practice' rules

### Commit style guide

The first line should be sentence case and present tense, e.g. Allow users to update profiles

The second line should be a space

The third line should be a link to a Trello card where possible that provides
context, and a place to discuss the story even after the commit is in master
(for anything more involved than a typo or bug fix)

The rest should document what you've done, focusing on 'why' you're making
this change, any edge cases you've thought about or any decisions you've made
that might not be obvious to someone looking at this in the future would need
to know before they make changes
